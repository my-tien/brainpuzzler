    <h2>About Brainpuzzler</h2>
    <p>Connectomics is the science of reconstructing entire networks of brain cells, called &lsquo;neurons&rsquo;. One great difficulty lies in the sheer number of neurons within a single creature. For example, larval zebrafish already have a complex nervous system with around 100,000 neurons. Another challenge is the small scale we have to work with: Neurons are measured in micrometers.</p>

    <p>Computers are able to process these vast amounts of information. They perform extremely fast neuron reconstructions after they learned how to recognize brain cells.</p>

    <p>But teaching computers to recognize objects in brain images is complex, the results are error-prone.</p>

    <p>Humans, on the other hand, work very slowly compared to computers, but are naturally superior when it comes to pattern recognition.</p>

    <p>So we came up with a solution that combines the strengths of both computers and humans:</p>

    <p>We take the micro-jobbing approach to let the internet community correct computer outputs of neuron reconstructions – and get paid for it. For this we put emphasize on enabling everybody to participate, without needing any background in neuroscience.</p>

    <p>Join the connectomics field and be an active part of research!</p>
