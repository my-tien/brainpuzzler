# brainpuzzler

Brainpuzzler is part of My-Tien Nguyen’s bachelor’s thesis from December 2014 to March 2015 about a micro-jobbing approach to segmentate neuronal 3d electron microscopy datasets.

We prepared computationally pre-segmented datasets as extremely simplified review tasks and presented them to online jobbers on [microworkers.com](microworkers.com).

Brainpuzzler connected to the Microworkers API and used Python and Django to store, manage and analyze micro-jobbers' submissions.
